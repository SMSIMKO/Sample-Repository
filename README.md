# How Divvy Homes is giving back the "American Dream"

## Overview

* Divvy Homes

* Incorporated in 2017

* Founded by Adena Hefets

* The idea came when she learned that her parents could not get a mortgage on a home when first coming to America. They found someone to let them rent the home with the option to purchase and that was the home that Adena grew up in. 

* The company is funded by investers and the last reporting was in 2021 at 1.2 billion. 


## Business Activities:

* The purpose of this startup was to help all American's acheive homeownership, seeing as homeownership creates generational wealth.  

* The target customer is a person that is currently renting and wants to become a homeowner but just does not have the credit score or the funding to do so. 
Most companies in this space offer a rental or a purchase, Divvy Homes offer a 3rd option that scales the ability for homeownership. 

* Divvy Homes is using many different technology platforms to run their business. According to Engineer, Alex Klarfeld with Divvy Homes " Weâ€™re dealing with not only structured data from providers like Plaid, but semi-structured and unstructured data in the form of full credit reports, pay stubs, and bank statements" He also mentions that they are using a "home grown Ledger system".


## Landscape:

* Divvy Homes is in the Realestate sector of fintech. 

* In the last 5-10 years we have seen more and more companies in the Real Estate field go to an online platform. You can now do all your financing online to get approved and purchase a home, which allows you to purchase homes anywhere in the US, site unseen, and to also find renters for that property, doing all the background checks and credit applications online. 

* Some other Major players in the the Real Estate domain are Morty, Cadre, and Roofstock, which all offer some type of investing in Real Estate. 


## Results

* The impact this company has had in the market today is over 750,000 customers in the US that have, or will in the next 3 years, acheive homeownership, when they would not have been able to otherwise. 

* Success in the Real Estate domain is determined by how many closings are being completed with that particular company. Divvy Homes also seems to record success to how much funding is received from Investors. Divvy closed 100 homes in the first year of starting and has continued to grow since and is currently funded at 1.2 billion.

* Right now the competitors are Halo and Landis. The funding from investors is about 400-450 Million. Compared to Divvy Homes, the competitors have a ways to go to catch up to the 1.2 billion of funding.  


## Recommendations

* I would advise Divvy Homes to develop their own all inclusive operating system that would serve the company and their customers. 

* I beleive this is needed considering Divvy Homes is having to use "piece systems" to run their business. They could then sell the use of the software to other Real Estate companies and their US and non-US competitors that would need to utilize the same tools as Divvy Homes.  

* This technology would benefit the company in order to limit funds being used on other software.  Divvy Homes could then benefit from the savings in order to decrease their fees to their consumers, this would  alow more low income families to acheive the gift of homeownership. 

* This technology is appropriate because WE ARE AMERICA and we all deserve the "American Dream"
